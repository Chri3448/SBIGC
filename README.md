# EPDF_ABC

Given models for spectra and luminosity statistics of multiple populations of sources, this code will analyze a photon data set to generate constraints on the model parameters using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC).

Inputs:
Description of source spectra and luminosity statistics.  The description of luminosity statistics can either be a luminosity function, or a photon count probability distribution function.

Outputs:
Samples from the model posterior.


To test the code, run "python test.py" or take a look at the example Jupyter notebook, ExampleEPDFABC.ipynb.
